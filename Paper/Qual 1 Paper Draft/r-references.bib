They estimated the model by using a covariance matrix calculated from sample-mean-centered variables and products of these variables. Subsequently, J{\"o}reskog and Yang (1996) identified the need to include intercepts for the measurement and structural equations and estimated the model by using a covariance matrix calculated from noncentered observed variables and products of these variables, and means of the observed variables and the products of noncentered variables. Evidence is presented that the J{\"o}reskog-Yang procedure for estimating the Kenny-Judd interaction model is subject to severe convergence problems when implemented in LISREL8.3 and means for the indicators of the latent exogenous variables are nonzero. An alternative procedure is presented that solves the convergence problem and provides consistent estimators of the parameters. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Errors-in-variables regression (EIVR) may remedy this problem as it corrects for measurement error in the regressors, and thus provides less biased parameter estimates. However, little is known about the properties of the EIVR estimators in the moderator variable context. The present study used simulation methods to compare the moderator variable detection capabilities of MMR and EIVR. Specifically, the study examined the bias and mean squared error of the MMR and EIVR estimates under varying conditions of sample size, reliability of the predictor variables, and intercorrelations among the predictor variables. Findings showed that EIVR estimates are superior to MMR estimates when sample size is high (i.e., at least 250) and the reliabilities of the predictors are high (i.e., rij {$\geq$} .65). However, MMR appears to be the better strategy when reliabilities or sample size are low.},

  abstract = {This bestselling text provides a practical guide to structural equation modeling (SEM) using the Amos Graphical approach. Using clear, everyday language, the text is ideal for those with little to no exposure to either SEM or Amos. The author reviews SEM applications based on actual data taken from her own research. Each chapter "walks" readers through the steps involved (specification, estimation, evaluation, and post hoc modification) in testing a variety of SEM models. Accompanying each application is: an explanation of the issues addressed and a schematic presentation of hypothesized model structure; Amos　 input and output with interpretations; use of the Amos toolbar icons and pull-down menus; and data upon which the model application was based, together with updated references pertinent to the SEM model　 tested. Thoroughly updated throughout, the new edition features: All new screen shots featuring Amos Version 23.　　  Descriptions and illustrations of Amos' new Tables View format which enables the specification of a structural model in spreadsheet form.　　　　  Key concepts and/or techniques that introduce each chapter.  Alternative approaches to model analyses when enabled by Amos thereby allowing users to determine the method best suited to their data.　  Provides analysis of the same model based on continuous and categorical data (Ch. 5) thereby enabling readers to observe two ways of specifying and testing the same model as well as compare results.  All applications based on the Amos graphical mode interface accompanied by more "how to" coverage of graphical techniques unique to Amos. More explanation of key procedures and analyses that address questions posed by readers  All application data files are available at www.routledge.com/9781138797031. The two introductory chapters in Section 1 review the fundamental concepts of SEM methodology and a general overview of the Amos program. Section 2 provides single-group analyses applications including two first-order confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) models, one second-order CFA model, and one full latent variable model. Section 3 presents multiple-group analyses applications with two rooted in the analysis of covariance structures and one in the analysis of mean and covariance structures. Two models that are increasingly popular with SEM practitioners, construct validity and testing change over time using the latent growth curve, are presented in Section 4. The book concludes with a review of the use of bootstrapping to address non-normal data and a review of missing (or incomplete) data in Section 5.  An ideal supplement for graduate level courses in psychology, education, business, and social and health sciences that cover the fundamentals of SEM with a focus on Amos, this practical text continues to be a favorite of both researchers and practitioners. A prerequisite of basic statistics through regression analysis is recommended but no exposure to either SEM or Amos is required.},

Tests divisible into distinct subtests should be so divided before using the formula. The index\$\${\textbackslash}bar r\_\{ij\} \$\$, derived from {$\alpha$}, is shown to be an index of inter-item homogeneity. Comparison is made to the Guttman and Loevinger approaches. Parallel split coefficients are shown to be unnecessary for tests of common types. In designing tests, maximum interpretability of scores is obtained by increasing the first-factor concentration in any separately-scored subtest and avoiding substantial group-factor clusters within a subtest.

This approach leaves the practitioner to choose the PIs to be included in the model, introducing arbitrariness into the modeling. In contrast to previous Monte Carlo studies, we evaluated the PI approach by 3 post hoc analyses applied to a real-world case adopted from a research effort in social psychology. The measurement design applied 3 and 4 indicators for the 2 latent 1st-order variables, leaving the researcher with a choice among more than 4,000 possible PI configurations. Sixty so-called matched-pair configurations that have been recommended in previous literature are of special interest. In the 1st post hoc analysis we estimated the interaction effect for all PI configurations, keeping the real-world sample fixed. The estimated interaction effect was substantially affected by the choice of PIs, also across matched-pair configurations. Subsequently, a post hoc Monte Carlo study was conducted, with varying sample sizes and data distributions. Convergence, bias, Type I error and power of the interaction test were investigated for each matched-pair configuration and the all-pairs configuration. Variation in estimates across matched-pair configurations for a typical sample was substantial. The choice of specific configuration significantly affected convergence and the interaction test's outcome. The all-pairs configuration performed overall better than the matched-pair configurations. A further advantage of the all-pairs over the matched-pairs approach is its unambiguity. The final study evaluates the all-pairs configuration for small sample sizes and compares it to the non-PI approach of latent moderated structural equations.

The robustness of an estimator against specific violations of assumptions can be determined empirically by means of a Monte Carlo study. Many such studies in covariance structure analysis have been published, but the conclusions frequently seem to contradict each other. An overview of robustness studies in covariance structure analysis is given, and an attempt is made to generalize findings. Robustness studies are described and distinguished from each other systematically by means of certain characteristics. These characteristics serve as explanatory variables in a meta-analysis concerning the behavior of parameter estimators, standard error estimators, and goodness-of-fit statistics when the model is correctly specified.},

Such analyses can be conducted with observed variables (e.g., a typical regression approach) or latent variables (e.g., a structural equation modeling approach), and choosing between these methods can be a more complex and consequential decision than researchers often realize. The present article adds to the literature on mediation by examining the relative trade-off between accuracy and precision in latent versus observed variable modeling. Whereas past work has shown that latent variable models tend to produce more accurate estimates, we demonstrate that this increase in accuracy comes at the cost of increased standard errors and reduced power, and examine this relative trade-off both theoretically and empirically in a typical 3-variable mediation model across varying levels of effect size and reliability. We discuss implications for social psychologists seeking to uncover mediating variables and provide 3 practical recommendations for maximizing both accuracy and precision in mediation analyses.

To minimize the frequency of nonconvergence, this paper proposes a solution called bounded estimation. The idea is to use data-driven lower and upper bounds for a subset of the model parameters during estimation. In this paper, we provide a rationale to compute these bounds, and we study the effect of different approaches to employ these bounds on the frequency of nonconvergence. A simulation study shows that bounded estimation dramatically decreases the frequency of nonconvergence in both correctly and misspecified models, without any (negative) effects on the quality of the point estimates for the unbounded parameters.}

Although joint modeling of measurement and structural models can theoretically yield consistent structural association estimates, estimating a model with many variables is often impractical in small samples. A viable alternative is two-stage path analysis (2S-PA), where researchers first obtain factor scores and the corresponding individual-specific reliability coefficients, and then use those factor scores to analyze structural associations while accounting for their unreliability. The current paper extends 2S-PA to also account for partial invariance. Two simulation studies show that 2S-PA outperforms joint modeling in terms of model convergence, the efficiency of structural parameter estimation, and confidence interval coverage, especially in small samples and with categorical indicators. We illustrate 2S-PA by reanalyzing data from a multiethnic study that predicts drinking problems using college-related alcohol beliefs.},

  abstract = {When estimating path coefficients among psychological constructs measured with error, structural equation modeling (SEM), which simultaneously estimates the measurement and structural parameters, is generally regarded as the gold standard. In practice, however, researchers usually first compute composite scores or factor scores, and use those as observed variables in a path analysis, for purposes of simplifying the model or avoiding model convergence issues. Whereas recent approaches, such as reliability adjustment methods and factor score regression, has been proposed to mitigate the bias induced by ignoring measurement error in composite/factor scores with continuous indicators, those approaches are not yet applicable to models with categorical indicators. In this article, we introduce the two-stage path analysis (2S-PA) with definition variables as a general framework for path modeling to handle categorical indicators, in which estimation of factor scores and path coefficients are separated. It thus allows for different estimation methods in the measurement and the structural path models and easier diagnoses of violations of model assumptions. We conducted three simulation studies, ranging from latent regression to mediation analysis with categorical indicators, and showed that 2S-PA generally produced similar estimates to those using SEM in large samples, but gave better convergence rates, less standard error bias, and better control of Type I error rates in small samples. We illustrate 2S-PA using data from a national data set, and show how researchers can implement it in Mplus and OpenMx. Possible extensions and future directions of 2S-PA are discussed.

A key benefit of the orthogonalizing strategy is that it eliminated the need to estimate a mean structure as required by the mean-centering strategy, but required a potentially cumbersome 2-step estimation procedure. In contrast, the double-mean-centering strategy eliminates both the need for the mean structure and the cumbersome 2-stage estimation procedure. Furthermore, although the orthogonalizing and double-mean-centering strategies are equivalent when all indicators are normally distributed, the double-mean-centering strategy is superior when this normality assumption is violated. In summary, we recommend that applied researchers wanting to estimate latent interaction effects use the double-mean-centering strategy instead of either the single-mean-centering or orthogonalizing strategies, thus allowing them to ignore the cumbersome mean structure.},

An interesting finding was that the probability of detection of a product (interaction) term increases as the correlation between x and w increases; it is known that the reliability of a product term increases similarly. An unexpected finding was the inflated probabilities of Type I errors that occurred for direct effects of x or w when they were not directly related to the criterion in the underlying model. Detection of spurious direct effects was exacerbated by increased correlation between x and w. It is clear that moderated multiple regression is adversely affected by measurement error, but that the impact is complex.

Second, different facets under the same motivational dimensions interacted with each other when predicting reading performance. Third, reading motivation was a strong predictor of reading performance even after controlling for other literacy-related variables. Results confirmed the multidimensional and multifaceted nature of reading motivation with emphasis on the predictive power of internally oriented motivation.

Bollen's (1996) 2-stage least squares (TSLS) method, R. A. Ping's (1996) 2-step maximum likelihood (ML) method, and J. Jaccard and C. K. Wan's (1995) ML method for the Kenny--Judd model (D. A. Kenny and C. M. Judd, 1984); (2) a 2-step ML procedure and ML estimation of the J{\"o}reskog--Yang model (K. G. J{\"o}reskog and F. Yang 1996); and (3) ML estimation of a revised J{\"o}reskog--Yang model. The TSLS procedure exhibited more bias and lower power than the other methods. Under ML estimation of the J{\"o}reskog--Yang model, Type I error rates were not well controlled when robust standard errors were used. Among the remaining procedures, the Jaccard--Wan procedure and ML estimation of the revised J{\"o}reskog--Yang procedure were most effective, with the latter having some small advantages over the former. A technical description of the simulation is appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

In reality there is no rule of thumb that applies to all situations. The sample size needed for a study depends on many factors, including the size of the model, distribution of the variables, amount of missing data, reliability of the variables, and strength of the relations among the variables. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how substantive researchers can use a Monte Carlo study to decide on sample size and determine power. Two models are used as examples, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model and a growth model. The analyses are carried out using the Mplus program (Muth{\'e}n\& Muth{\'e}n 1998).},

But there is still room for improvement in two areas: the fact that MAD\textsubscript{n} is aimed at symmetric distributions and its low (37\%) Gaussian efficiency. In this article we set out to construct explicit and 50\% breakdown scale estimators that are more efficient. We consider the estimator {$<$}tex-math{$>\$$}S\_n = 1.1926 {\textbackslash}operatorname\{med\}\_i{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}operatorname\{med\}\_j{\textbar}x\_i - x\_j{\textbar}{\textbackslash}\}\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} and the estimator Q\textsubscript{n} given by the .25 quantile of the distances {$<$}latex{$>\$\backslash$}\{{\textbar}x\_i - x\_j{\textbar}; i {$<$} j{\textbackslash}\}\${$<$}/latex{$>$}. Note that S\textsubscript{n} and Q\textsubscript{n} do not need any location estimate. Both S\textsubscript{n} and Q\textsubscript{n} can be computed using O(n log n) time and O(n) storage. The Gaussian efficiency of S\textsubscript{n} is 58\%, whereas Q\textsubscript{n} attains 82\%. We study S\textsubscript{n} and Q\textsubscript{n} by means of their influence functions, their bias curves (for implosion as well as explosion), and their finite-sample performance. Their behavior is also compared at non-Gaussian models, including the negative exponential model where S\textsubscript{n} has a lower gross-error sensitivity than the MAD.}

Estimating interactions using latent variables provides additional power to detect effects over testing interactions in regression. However, when predictors are modeled as latent variables, estimating and testing interactions requires additional steps beyond the models used for regression. We review methods of estimating and testing latent variable interactions with a focus on product indicator methods. Product indicator methods of examining latent interactions provide an accurate method to estimate and test latent interactions and can be implemented in any latent variable modeling software package. Significant latent interactions require additional steps (plotting and probing) to interpret interaction effects. We demonstrate how these methods can be easily implemented using functions in the semTools package with models fit using the lavaan package in R, and we illustrate how these methods work using an applied example concerning teacher stress and testing.},

  abstract = {Interaction effects between explanatory constructs are an important part of many social theories. Analyses of interaction effects between variables using regression techniques have low power because they do not control for measurement errors. Therefore, latent interaction modeling using structural equation modeling (SEM) has been proposed as a better alternative to test for interaction effects. In contrast to traditional and complicated ?constrained? SEM approaches, two recent developments, the unconstrained approach and the residual centering approach, are especially attractive for applied researchers as they are much easier to implement. However, applied researchers still seem to be unsure about how to apply these approaches. In this study, we illustrate the use of the unconstrained and the residual centering approach and compare these approaches with the constrained approach of Algina and Moulder (2001) using data from a field study of 1,442 students. Theoretical background is the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) in which we test the proposed interaction between an individual's intention to perform a behavior and perceived behavioral control (PBC) on behavior. The illustration should assist researchers interested in testing interaction effects using structural equation modeling.},

The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of ``close fit'' of a model is suggested.},

PIRLS also provides extensive information about the home and school contexts for learning to read. PIRLS 2006 was built on PIRLS 2001, with modifications designed to provide more useful and more comprehensive information to the participating countries. Forty countries and 5 Canadian provinces participated in the 2006 PIRLS assessment. Of these, 26 countries and 2 provinces had trend data from PIRLS 2001. The PIRLS 2006 test of reading comprehension was based on 10 passages, 5 literary and 5 informational. Building on the foundation provided in PIRLS 2001, the 2006 assessment included five questionnaires (for students, parents/caregivers, teachers, principals, and each country's National Research Coordinator) to collect data about the educational contexts for learning to read. This report covers the technical aspects of PIRLS 2006. It is divided into the following chapters: (1) Overview of PIRLS 2006 (Ina V.S. Mullis and Michael O. Martin); (2) Developing the PIRLS 2006 Reading Assessment and Scoring Guides (Ann M. Kennedy and Marian Sainsbury); (3) Developing the PIRLS 2006 Background Questionnaires (Ann M.

  abstract = {To assess the reliability of congeneric tests, specifically designed reliability measures have been proposed. This paper emphasizes that such measures rely on a unidimensionality hypothesis, which can neither be confirmed nor rejected when there are only three test parts, and will invariably be rejected when there are more than three test parts. Jackson and Agunwamba's (1977) greatest lower bound to reliability is proposed instead. Although this bound has a reputation for overestimating the population value when the sample size is small, this is no reason to prefer the unidimensionality-based reliability. Firstly, the sampling bias problem of the glb does not play a role when the number of test parts is small, as is often the case with congeneric measures. Secondly, glb and unidimensionality based reliability are often equal when there are three test parts, and when there are more test parts, their numerical values are still very similar. To the extent that the bias problem of the greatest lower bound does play a role, unidimensionality-based reliability is equally affected. Although unidimensionality and reliability are often thought of as unrelated, this paper shows that, from at least two perspectives, they act as antagonistic concepts. A measure, based on the same framework that led to the greatest lower bound, is discussed for assessing how close is a set of variables to unidimensionality. It is the percentage of common variance that can be explained by a single factor. An empirical example is given to demonstrate the main points of the paper.},
